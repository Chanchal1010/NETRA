## üí∏Applications

- Outdoor Mobility: The Smart Stick assists visually impaired individuals in safely navigating outdoor environments, including sidewalks, streets, and pedestrian crossings. It detects obstacles, such as vehicles, poles, or uneven terrain, and provides real-time feedback to the user to avoid collisions.
- Indoor Navigation: In indoor settings, such as buildings, shopping malls, or public facilities, the Smart Stick helps users navigate through hallways, corridors, and rooms. It can detect obstacles like furniture, walls, and doors, providing guidance and directional cues to reach desired destinations.
- Public Transportation: The Smart Stick aids visually impaired individuals in accessing public transportation systems, including bus stops, train platforms, and subway stations. It assists users in locating boarding points, navigating through crowded areas, and identifying departure times and routes.
- Obstacle Detection: Beyond navigation, the Smart Stick serves as a valuable tool for detecting obstacles in various environments, alerting users to potential hazards and barriers in their path. This includes detecting low-hanging branches, overhead obstacles, and protruding objects.
- Education and Training: The Smart Stick can be used as a training tool for orientation and mobility instructors to teach visually impaired individuals essential navigation skills and techniques. It simulates real-world scenarios and provides feedback to help users develop confidence and independence.
